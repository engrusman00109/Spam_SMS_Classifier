# Spam Message Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Spam Message Detection system using various machine learning classifiers and ensemble techniques. The goal is to accurately classify messages as spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content.

### Workflow and Techniques

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gathered a dataset of labeled spam and ham messages.
   - Preprocessed text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extracted features such as word frequencies and TF-IDF values.
   - Selected significant features using model-based techniques.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Implemented multiple classifiers including KNeighborsClassifier, MultinomialNB, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, BaggingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, SVC, GradientBoostingClassifier, and XGBClassifier.
   - Trained classifiers on preprocessed data to learn distinguishing patterns.

4. **Voting Classifier:**
   - Developed a Voting Classifier to combine predictions from diverse base classifiers.

5. **Stacking:**
   - Applied stacking with a meta-learner to further enhance prediction accuracy.

### Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy:** 98.07%
- **Precision:** 95.38%

### Future Enhancements

- Integrate deep learning models for more complex text representations.
- Explore real-time spam detection using streaming data techniques.
- Enhance user interface for better interaction and deployment.

This project demonstrates effective utilization of machine learning techniques to combat spam messages, providing a robust solution for text classification tasks.
